App:
- App icon + SplashScreen
- Shared TopAppBar
- Navigation with custom data items
- DB
- Connection to server via retrofit2, import data
- Before import, check if up to date
- Show question again if answered incorrectly
- Select questions depending on due date (also check if any questions are due at all. If not ask if study ahead)
- Display StudySession result in dialog
- Buttons only enabled if it makes sense (select category, 確認)
- Custom reusable views (ExpandableView, CardView, NoDataScreen, LoadingSpinner, Charts, ...)
- Tabs navigation (AnalysisScreen)
- Snackbar
- Chart libraries: MPAndroidChart + Vico (customisation)
- Filtertext, filter on input
- Sort
- Image handling (Base64, load from server, decode bitmap)
- Dark mode handling
- Read from/write to DB
- Data handling/routing via ViewModel
- Delete deck (on delete cascade does not work because on conflict replace works delete -> insert)
- Show larger image on click
- Show explanation
- Custom colors in MaterialTheme
- Store/Read data from DataStore (numToStudy, connection details)
- Handle orientation changes
- Use string.xml (translatable)
- Memo
- Except for data import, everything works offline



Server:
- DB with Models
- CRUD deck
- CRUD question
- API endpoints (returns JSON)
- Import of zip with csv (Header: 分野,問題,画像問題,ア,イ,ウ,エ,画像ア,画像イ,画像ウ,画像エ,正解,解説,出典)
- deck version increment on change
- Save old values on page refresh
- Localization
- Quick&dirty server, since app is focus




What I wanted to use:
- DB
- ViewModel
- DataStore
- API call (retrofit2)
- Async functions (Import, DataStore)
- Generics (DataStore, CustomNavType)
- Custom reusable views
- Navigation
- Jetpack compose
- Libraries
- AndroidView for code written without compose
- Filter TextField
- Charts
- Dark mode


TODO:
Tests? e.g. ExpandableView (showContent when rotated)
Https?


Specialties because of presentation:
- Study ahead
- No retired status

Problems:
Main problem: Connection to server with actual device in school (because Smartphone can't use same network because of school rules)
Other than that everything was solvable withing 1-2 days by googling
